# <img src="frontend/public/favicon/PixelEditor-favicon-large.png" width="40px" /> Pixel Editor

A simple web application for creating pixel art, made using the React library.

If connected to a database, the gallery displays all saved images and their details. Images can be edited or deleted via a button on their card, and saved to the database from the editor.

The editor has 3 tools: the **brush**, **fill bucket**, and **eyedropper**, as well as color pickers.

## ðŸ›  Setup

1. Clone this repository.

2. Prepare two terminals:
   - type `cd frontend` in first;
   - type `cd backend` in second.

3. Type `npm install` in both terminals to install the dependencies.

4. *<u>( This step is optional. )</u>* If you have a database to connect with this application, perform these steps:
   - Create an `.env` file in the `backend` folder:
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL=<YOUR DATABASE URL HERE>
    ```
   - Depending on the database you might need to change the `schema.prisma` file or re-generate it again using the `prisma init` command (please copy over the Image model, as that's not generated). This project was originally made with an [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) database.

> **Note:** Omitting this step means you will not be using a database, which makes the `backend` part of the project unusable. If you omitted step 4, please ignore further instructions for the `backend` folder.
> 
> The application will fail to connect to the database, but will otherwise function normally and allow to create and edit images. Naturally, saving images will not work.

5. Type `npm start` in both terminals to boot the application.

6. The app is now accessible on http://localhost:3000/
